Snippet AjaxImageUpload
MODX Snippet/jQuery Script Wrapper for Andrew Valums great file upload script http://valums.com/ajax-upload/

Usage:
- Non Ajax Page: [!AjaxImageUpload? &mode=`form` &ajaxId=`779` &uid=`uniqueid` &language=`german` &allowedExtensions=`jpg,jpeg,png,gif` &thumbX=`75` &thumbY=`75`!]
- AJAX page: [!AjaxImageUpload? &mode=`ajax` &language=`german` &allowedExtensions=`jpg,jpeg,png,gif` &maxFilesizeMb=`2` &thumbX=`100` &thumbY=`100`!]

Annotations:
- Install with following snippet code: 
  <?php return include MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/snippets/AjaxImageUpload/AjaxImageUpload.snippet.php'; ?>
- Most of the parameters have default values (see snippet code)
- Images will be saved with an unique filename in assets/cache/AjaxImageUpload
- The image properties will be saved in $_SESSION['AjaxImageUpload'][$uid][$id] 
  as array('originalName', 'uniqueName', 'thumbName', 'path') and should be 
  moved from there during the other form process. ($uid should be set on non 
  ajax page, $id is the number of the image)
- The unique id could be created for each form (to separate multiple upload 
  queues) and maybe each pageview (to separate uploads for the same queue and 
  session but i.e. in different tabs)
